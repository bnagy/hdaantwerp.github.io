    "The most simple and common application of a chi-squared test is that to study the correlation between two categorical variables with just two levels. The test is then carried out on a 2x2 table of counts (with *df*=1). In this notebook, we will see that the chi-squared test has a wider applicability, however. We'll cover two more examples from the Spanish novels dataset, which contains metadata on the protagonist in each of the books:"
