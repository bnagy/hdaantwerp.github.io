    "# Bayesian Inference: kudos over time in fan-fiction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework you will investigate an effect over time of popularity measures in fan-fiction. A lot of research uses proxy measures of popularity, and it has often been observed that the measures themselves are biased, which needs to be taken into account.\n",
    "\n",
    "An Archive Of Our Own (AO3) is a huge collection of \"fan-fiction\" (stories written by fans set in universes created by popular novels, comics, or TV series). These texts are shared and read by users of the site, who can award a 'kudos' to the work if they enjoyed it. It is natural to use this as a \"proxy measure\" of popularity. The problem with this is that works naturally accrue some kudos over time (they have more opportunities for people to read them and give them kudos), and so recent works are disadvantaged by measuring popularity this way.\n",
